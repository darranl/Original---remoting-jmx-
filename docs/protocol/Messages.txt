This document contains a brief description of the messages exchanged between the two
sides of the connection after the Remoting channel has been selected.

* All Versions *

 Server advertises it's capabilities
Server -> Client  -  JMX {version count} {list of versions} {stability indicator}

 Client selects a version.
Client -> Server  -  JMX {selected version}

* Version One *

 Welcome Message
Server -> Client  -  JMX {connection id}

At this point the connection is established and bi-directional communication can begin, however in general
the client is going to need to send in some registrations first before notifications are emitted althoug
the first message from the server could be to indicate a shut down.
